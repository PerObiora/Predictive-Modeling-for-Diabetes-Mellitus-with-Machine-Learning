# Predictive-Modeling-for-Diabetes-Mellitus-with-Machine-Learning
This kernel will examine the prevalence of diabetes in adults based on common factors, 
that are understood to be correlated to the occurence of diabetes. Itâ€™s main focus lies within the analysis of 9 factors: 
Past pregnancies, blood glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, blood insulin level, body mass index (BMI), 
diabetes pedigree function, and age. The factors related to the occurrence will be analyzed to see what proportion each
contributes to the occurrence of diabetes. We will see how the factors and attributes are interrelated by doing a pairwise 
comparison. We will use 3 main algorithms: "Support Vector Machine with a linear kernel", "Support vector machine with a 
radial kernel", "Linear regression", and the "Decision tree algorithm" to examine a matrix of 2000x10 data points,
collected from hospitalized individuals in Frankfurt, Germany. By utilizing these algorithms we will examine the 
effectiveness of each in predicting the probability of a person to have diabetes based on the prevalence and results 
of the above mentioned diagnostic measurements.

You can download the code file & the data and run it yourself.
Data is acquired from a hospital in Germany, Frankfurt.
